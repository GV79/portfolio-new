This is a new portfolio website I am creating using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to improve on the initial design, create a faster and more maintainable React.js app, and became more familiar with this tool (React.js framework with performance benefits and SSR for better SEO than CRA). My older portfolio website (hosted [here](https://eloquent-bhaskara-4b11e4.netlify.app/)) was originally made using HTML, CSS, and native JavaScript.

This website is deployed on Vercel here: [https://giavinhlam.me](https://giavinhlam.me)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser to see the page.

## To Do
1. Add old chat, socsreynolds, and form builder projects
2. Defer loading of resume as it is initially offscreen on first load
3. Optimize size of codeconnect1.PNG as it is currently 282 kB
4. Consider adding framer motion for animations/transitions
5. Upgrade to Nextjs v10 and incorporate image optimizations

6. Disabled buttons on featured projects page for mobile navs
7. Maybe page per project to make it faster rather than do it dynamically (can then use link tags effectively)
8. Dates
