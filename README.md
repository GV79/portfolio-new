This is a new portfolio website I am creating using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to improve on the initial design, optimize the speed, and became more familiar with this tool (React.js framework with performance benefits and SSR for better SEO than CRA).

This website is deployed on Netlify here: [www.placeholderwebsite.com](https://placeholderwebsite.com)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser to see the page.
