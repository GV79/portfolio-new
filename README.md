This is a new portfolio website I am creating using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to improve on the initial design, create a faster and more maintainable React.js app, and became more familiar with this tool (React.js framework with performance benefits and SSR for better SEO than CRA). My older portfolio website (hosted [here](https://eloquent-bhaskara-4b11e4.netlify.app/)) was originally made using HTML, CSS, and native JavaScript.

This website is deployed on Vercel here: [https://portfolio-new-eight.vercel.app/](https://portfolio-new-eight.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser to see the page.
