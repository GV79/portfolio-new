This is a new portfolio website I am creating using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to improve on the initial design, create a faster and more maintainable React.js app, and became more familiar with this tool (React.js framework which uses SSR & SSG for better performance and SEO). My older portfolio website (hosted [here](https://eloquent-bhaskara-4b11e4.netlify.app/)) was originally made using HTML, CSS, and native JavaScript.

This website is deployed on Vercel here: [https://giavinhlam.me](https://giavinhlam.me)
